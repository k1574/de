xde
===

xde - X desktop environment.

Description
-----------

The package contains collection of programs that follow the DRY UNIX KISS principles
to work in X11 based environments and more to work in the console.
They are simple, compact and are enough for the most purposes. (my own experience)
Some of programs are slightly rewritten to be easier built and used.
There are Plan 9 OS programs ports since they are effective and easy to use,
Suckless projects and a few more scripts from me.

Install
-------

Every programs is installed in $HOME/exe directory because I think people
must have the directory where they can put their own executables, since
root permission is too much for installation scripts.
Also I think people can want to change source much as I do
so they will replace programs installed by default in the system.

Licensies
---------

Every project has it's own license with the "license" name.
