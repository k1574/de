xde
===

xde - X desktop environment.

Description
-----------

The package contains collection of programs that follow the DRY UNIX KISS philosophies.
Graphical programs are supposed to be run in X environments.
They are simple, compact and are enough for the most purposes. 
Some of programs are slightly rewritten to be easier built and used.
There are Plan 9 OS programs ports since they are effective and easy to use,
Suckless projects and a few more scripts from me.

Install
-------

	% git clone https://github.com/k1574/xde
	% cd xde
	% ./install

Every programs is installed in $HOME/exe directory because I think people
must have the directory where they can put their own executables, since
root permission is too much for installation scripts.
It's dangerous to install anything globally.
Also I think people can want to change source much as I do
so they will replace programs installed by default in the system.

Run
---

	% xde # From the console.

Licensies
---------

Every project has it's own license with the "license" name.
Mostly MIT is used.
