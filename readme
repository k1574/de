xde
===

xde - X desktop environment.

Description
-----------

The package contains collection of programs that follow the DRY UNIX KISS principles
to work in X11 based environments and more to work in the console.
They are simple, compact and are enough for the most purposes. (my own experience)
Some of programs are slightly rewritten to be easier built and used.
There are Plan 9 OS programs ports since they are effective and easy to use,
Suckless projects and a few more scripts from me.
